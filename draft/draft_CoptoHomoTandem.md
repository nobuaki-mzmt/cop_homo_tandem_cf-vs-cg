**Abstract**

Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is an enigma in behavioral ecology as it
does not result in reproduction. Proximately, the evolution of sexual
signals is critical for the evolution of SSB in a sex-specific manner.
For signal receivers, the loss of sexual signals leads to smaller
phenotypic sex differences, leading to frequent accidental SSB between
receivers. Alternatively, for senders, sexual signals could help locate
another sender, enhancing intentional SSB as in heterosexual pairing.
Here, we demonstrate this link between sex pheromone signaling and the
frequency of same-sex pairing in two *Coptotermes* termites that use the
same chemical as sex pheromones but in different quantities. In
termites, mating pairs engage in tandem runs, where a male follows a
female with sex pheromones. We found that female-female tandems were
more stable in *C. formosanus,* whose females produce more pheromones,
while the male-male interactions were more frequent in *C. gestroi*,
whose females produce fewer pheromones. Thus, stronger pheromones lead
to sender-sender SSB, while weaker pheromones lead to receiver-receiver
SSB. In both species, same-sex tandems were less stable than
heterosexual tandems, contrasting with *Reticulitermes*, another termite
group that shows frequent same-sex tandems. The proximate mechanism of
SSB is diverse, reflecting the heterosexual context.

**Introduction**

Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is widespread among diverse animals with
considerable variations across taxa \[1–3\]. In most species, the SSB is
considered to result from mistaken identity \[3,4\]. In some cases, SSB
provides adaptive value by making the best of a bad job with the
shortage of heterosexual partners \[5,6\]. In either case, the
occurrence of SSB is dependent on the mode of mating strategy in
heterosexual contexts and strongly affected by the accuracy and
carefulness of sex identification of the mating partner \[7\]. Sexual
communication, mediated via sex-specific attracting signals (e.g., sex
pheromones), underlies such sexual identification of the other sex.
Therefore, even if the SSB does not have adaptive value, the
evolutionary patterns of sexual signals could shape the diversity of SSB
across species as a by-product. However, the role of sex-specific
signals in SSB has remained unexplored.

As signal senders and receivers play distinct roles in mate pairing, the
effect of sexual signals on SSB should differ between sender-sender and
receiver-receiver pairs. For example, the strength of sexual signals has
the opposite effect on the sender-sender SSB and receiver-receiver SSB.
In species with weak sex-specific signals, more frequent SSB between
receivers is expected compared with those with strong signals \[8\].
Because it needs more effort for receivers to distinguish senders from
receivers with weak sexual signals, receivers may mistake the sex of the
partner. On the other hand, more SSB between signal senders could be
possible in the species with strong signals. It is rarer to observe SSB
between senders as they are usually the passive sex during paring \[9\].
Nevertheless, if the signals are strong enough, it should be easier for
even senders to find other senders than other receivers. Thus, the
strength of sexual signals is expected to modify the relative occurrence
of receiver-receiver and sender-sender SSB across species.

Mate pairing in termites provides an ideal model system to study the
evolution of SSB. Termites form life-long monogamous pairs to establish
colonies \[10\]. During a brief period, alates (winged adults) disperse
from their nests. Both females and males land on the ground or trees,
shed their wings, and run to search for a mating partner. Upon joining,
a pair performs a tandem run. In neoisopteran termites, the male always
follows the female that produces sex pheromones \[11\], maintaining
contact in a highly coordinated manner while seeking a suitable site for
colony foundation. Although tandem running involves communication via
sex pheromones, same-sex tandem running can be observed in either sex
\[11,12\]. Sex pheromones should play different roles between
female-female pairs and male-male pairs. In male-male pairs, same-sex
tandem can happen once one male starts following another male. Thus, in
the case of male-male tandems, SSB can happen because of mistaken
identity. This implies that species with weak sex pheromones may provoke
male-male tandem pairing. On the other hand, female-female tandem should
not come from the mistaken identity because the sex role is fixed
(females do not follow males) \[11,13\], and one female needs to change
the sex role before the initiation of female-female tandem runs when not
approached by males. This implies that female-female tandem runs could
be intentional. Thus, conversely, the strong pheromone signal of females
instead facilitates same-sex tandems, where females can easily follow
another female.

In this study, we compared the same-sex tandem running behavior in two
*Coptotermes* termites: *Coptotermes formosanus* Shiraki and
*Coptotermes gestroi* (Wasmann). These two species share the same
chemical for sex-pairing pheromones ((3Z,6Z,8E)-dodeca-3,6,8-trien-1-ol)
produced by female tergal glands \[14\] and were previously observed
forming hetero-specific tandem runs \[15,16\]. However, the quantity of
pheromones differs between these two species, where *C. formosanus*
females produce ten times more pheromones than *C. gestroi* females
\[14\]. Due to this signal difference, we here expect that male-male
tandem is more frequent in *C. gestroi* than *C. formosanus*, while
female-female tandem is more frequent in *C. formosanus* than *C.
gestroi*. Finally, when a pair is separated during a heterosexual tandem
run, both species display sexual dimorphism, with females pausing to
wait for males and males moving around to search for females. \[17,18\].
We, therefore, also investigated if an individual could display the
typical behavior of the opposite sex in interrupted same-sex tandem
runs, as shown in another termite lineage \[11\].

**Methods**

*Termites and Experimental Arena*

We collected alates using a light-trapping system \[19\] at dusk between
27-29 March for *C. gestroi* and 21-22 April, 1-2 May for *C.
formosanus* in 2021 in Broward County (Florida, USA) during synchronized
dispersal flights. We collected all the alates at a single site. We
brought the alates to the laboratory and maintained them on wet
cardboard at 28°C. We used individuals who did not shed their wings by
themselves to prevent any prior experience with tandem runs. After
inducing shedding wings, we observed their behaviors within 12 h. We
used each termite only once.

We performed all observations in an experimental arena made of a Petri
dish (ø = 150 mm) filled with moistened plaster. The Petri dish had a
clear lid during observations. A video camera (HC-V770, Panasonic,
Osaka, Japan) was above the arena, adjusted so that the arena filled the
camera frame. We introduced a pair of termites into the arena. Each pair
was recorded for 30 minutes in 30 frames per second (FPS). We obtained
49, 61, and 44 videos for female-male, female-female, and male-male in
*C. formosanus*, and 40, 40, and 45 videos in *C. gestroi*. We extracted
the coordinates of the centroids of termite movements from all obtained
videos using the video-tracking system UMATracker \[20\]. We
down-sampled all coordinates to a rate of five FPS for subsequent
analyses. We measured the diameter of the dish and body length of two
termites in pixels for each video using a Python program.

*Tandem analysis*

To compare the duration of tandem runs between pair combinations and
species, we automatically determined that pairs were in interactions
when the distance between their centroids was within the sum of their
body length. We did not count short interactions (\< 5 seconds) as
interactions and short separations (\< 2 seconds) during interactions as
interruptions. Then, for each interaction event, we estimated the leader
by checking the relative directions of partners and their movement
directions. We calculated the dot products of these two vectors and
defined whether each partner was leading the other (dot vector \< 1, the
partner exists behind the moving direction) or not (dot vector ≧ 1).
During each interaction event, we regarded termites in tandem only when
one individual was the predominant leader, where the proportion of time
being a leader for one individual was more than 50% of the total
interaction duration. This treatment excluded non-tandem interactions,
such as inspecting the partner by antennation or staying together while
inspecting a specific area of the arena.

We compared the proportion of the total time spent in interactions,
tandem runs, and non-tandem interactions across different pairing
combinations (heterosexual, female–female, or male–male) for each
species, or between species for each pairing combination. We transformed
proportional data using logit transformation after adding 0.01 to the
observed proportions to avoid infinite values \[21\]. We used the Welch
t-tests to compare species for each pair combination, while one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD to compare combinations for each species. In the
t-test and Tukey’s HSD, we obtained Cohen’s d value as effect sizes
\[cohens_d() function in the rstatix package in R\]. We also studied how
tandem runs were stable once they started by comparing the duration of
each tandem running event. We used mixed-effects Cox models \[coxme()
function in the coxme package in R \[22\]\], with pair combination (or
species) treated as a fixed effect and each pair id as a random effect.
We compared the durations between species for each combination and among
combinations for each species separately.

Finally, for each separation event after tandem running events, we
obtained the movement speed of both leader and follower termites after 5
seconds of separation to compare the movement speed between them, using
a paired t-test with Cohen’s d value as effect sizes. We also calculated
the absolute difference in movement speed. We compared the difference in
movement speed using linear mixed-effects models \[lmer() function in
the lme4 package in R \[23\]\], using the same approach as the above
mixed-effect Cox models.

All data analyses were performed using R v4.3.0 \[24\], and source codes
are available on GitHub
(<https://github.com/nobuaki-mzmt/cop_homo_tandem_cf-vs-cg>).

**Results**

The species difference in tandem running behavior depended on the
pairing combinations. In heterosexual pairing, *C. formosanus* spent
longer time for tandem runs than *C. gestroi* (t-test,
*t*<sub>88.0</sub> = 4.30, *P* \< 0.001, *d* = 0.90, Figure 1C) or
interactions (t-test, *t*<sub>84.3</sub> = 5.38, *P* \< 0.001, *d* =
1.14, Figure 1B), but not for non-tandem interactions (t-test,
*t*<sub>88.0</sub> = 1.04, *P* = 0.299, *d* = 0.22, Figure 1D). Once
they started tandem runs, *C. formosanus* showed more stable tandems
(mixed-effects Cox model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 40.3, *P* \<
0.001, Figure S1). Note that this result contradicts a previous study
that detected no significant difference between these two species
\[16\], and this contradiction is discussed in the supplementary
material (see Supplementary Text S1, Figure S2, and Table S1). A similar
pattern was observed in female-female pairing, where *C. formosanus*
spent longer time for tandem runs (t-test, *t*<sub>96.4</sub> = 8.62,
*P* \< 0.001, *d* = 1.65, Figure 1C) and showed more stable tandems than
*C. gestroi* (mixed-effects Cox model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 9.42,
*P* = 0.002, Figure S1). Note that time spent in interactions was not
different (t-test, *t*<sub>83.6</sub> = 1.62, *P* = 0.11, *d* = 0.33,
Figure 1B) because *C. gestroi* expended more time for non-tandem
interactions (t-test, *t*<sub>75.2</sub> = 5.67, *P* \< 0.001, *d* =
1.17, Figure 1D). On the other hand, male-male pairing showed a distinct
pattern, where *C. gestroi* spent longer for same-sex interactions than
*C. formosanus* (t-test, *t*<sub>73.9</sub> = 6.36, *P* \< 0.001, *d* =
1.35, Figure 1B). The most social interactions in *C. gestroi* did not
end up tandem runs as there was no difference in the time spent in
tandem runs between species (t-test, *t*<sub>78.5</sub> = 0.93, *P* \<
0.353, *d* = 0.20, Figure 1C), but *C. gestroi* expended much more time
for non-tandem interactions (t-test, *t*<sub>84.9</sub> = 7.43, *P* \<
0.001, *d* = 1.58, Figure 1D). Interestingly, once tandem started, *C.
formosanus* showed more stable tandems than *C. gestroi* (mixed-effects
Cox model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 33.4, *P* \< 0.001, Figure S1).
However, in either species, same-sex tandem runs were much less stable
than heterosexual pairing, with larger difference between female-female
pairs and male-male pairs in *C. formosanus* (mixed-effects Cox model,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 481, *P* \< 0.001; Tukey’s HSD, FM-FF: *P*
\< 0.001; FM-MM: *P* \< 0.001; FF-MM: *P* \< 0.001; Figure S1), while no
difference between female-female pairs and male-male pairs in *C.
gestroi* (mixed-effects Cox model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 174, *P*
\< 0.001; Tukey’s HSD, FM-FF: *P* \< 0.001; FM-MM: *P* \< 0.001; FF-MM:
*P* = 0.839; Figure S1). The same pattern was observed in the time spent
in tandem runs (Figure 1C).

After separations, combinations with stable tandem runs showed clear
speed differences between partners (Figure 2). As shown in previous
studies \[17,18\], in heterosexual pairs, male followers sped up while
female leaders slowed down after separation to enhance the probability
of reunions in both *C. formosanus* (t-test, *t*<sub>366</sub> = 16.9,
*P* \< 0.001, *d* = 1.60) and *C. gestroi* (t-test, *t*<sub>438</sub> =
15.7, *P* \< 0.001, *d* = 1.34). Similar movement differences between
partners were observed in the female-female pairing of *C. formosanus*
(t-test, *t*<sub>1208</sub> = 20.1, *P* \< 0.001, *d* = 1.15), which
shows stable tandem runs (Figure 1C, S1). However, in other same-sex
pairs, the speed difference between leaders and followers after
separation was small and had negligible effect sizes; male-male pair in
*C. formosanus* (t-test, *t*<sub>278</sub> = 0.03, *P* = 0.978, *d* =
0.003), female-female pair in *C. gestroi* (t-test, *t*<sub>300</sub> =
3.62, *P* \< 0.001, *d* = 0.39), and male-male pair in *C. gestroi*
(t-test, *t*<sub>353</sub> = 2.13, *P* = 0.034, *d* = 0.22). Similarly,
the levels of difference between partners were smaller in same-sex
pairing, compared with heterosexual pairs both in *C. formosanus* (LMM,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 73.6, *P* \< 0.001; Tukey’s HSD, FM-FF: *z*
= 4.26, *P* \< 0.001; FM-FF: *z* = 8.57, *P* \< 0.001; FM-FF: *z* =
5.69, *P* \< 0.001) and *C. gestroi* (LMM, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> =
52.6, *P* \< 0.001; Tukey’s HSD, FM-FF: *z* = 5.65, *P* \< 0.001; FM-FF:
*z* = 6.56, *P* \< 0.001; FM-FF: *z* = 0.844, *P* = 0.675).

**Discussion**

We found an association between same-sex pairing behavior and sex
pheromone quantity in two termite species with shared chemicals. First,
female-female pairing was more stable in *C. formosanus*, the species
with more sex pheromones. Because females are leaders in heterosexual
pairs of *Coptotermes* termites, females need to decide to play follower
roles before the initiation of same-sex pairing \[11\], where females
could use sex pheromones to maintain stable movement coordination with
same-sex individuals. On the other hand, although both species showed
little male-male tandem running, *C. gestroi* males, the species with a
smaller quantity of sex pheromones, spent more time interacting with
same-sex partners. Male-male pairings of these species could be driven
by mistaken identity, where *C. gestroi* required more time to inspect
the partner’s sex due to smaller sexual dimorphism. Either way, our
study clearly demonstrated that the evolution of SSB in termites is
inseparable from the evolution of sex-attracting signals.

By comparing with other termite lineages, our results suggest that the
same-sex tandems in *Coptotermes* termites are not functional behaviors
but could exist because they inherited them from the ancestral state of
termite tandem running behavior \[11\], as in the framework of the
previous work \[4\]. Previous studies on same-sex tandem runs in
termites have focused only on *Reticulitermes* termites \[11,12,25,26\],
which belong to the same family as *Coptotermes*. In *Reticulitermes*
termites, same-sex pairing functions by providing survival benefits
\[5,12,27\] and is not a result of mistaken identity \[11\]. However, a
distinct pattern observed in *Coptotermes* termites suggests that
same-sex tandem in *Coptotermes* termites is rather a behavior expressed
outside of its original function. In *Reticulitermes* termites, same-sex
tandem pairs were as stable as heterosexual tandem pairs, and one
partner behaves like the other sex upon separation \[11\]. In
*Coptotermes* termites, on the other hand, even once they form a
same-sex tandem pair, both female-female and male-male tandems were far
less stable than heterosexual tandems (Figure 1, S1). Furthermore, upon
separation, movement dimorphisms between partners, a key for efficient
reunion, were not as strong as heterosexual pairs or even absent (Figure
2). These all indicate that *Coptotermes* termites do not tend to adjust
their movement patterns to maintain same-sex tandems actively. The
exception is *C. formosanus* female-female pairing, which may have an
unknown behavioral function.

Even though the same-sex pairing of *Coptotermes* termites is not
adaptive, our study on their interspecific variations shows the
mechanical aspects of the evolution of SSB. For example, a previous
theoretical study predicted that SSB is caused by the absence of perfect
sex discrimination, where the loss of sexual signals and indiscriminate
mating coevolve together \[28\]. Our result supports this idea by
showing that the species with weaker sexual signals showed more frequent
same-sex interactions than the other. In other words, *C. gestroi* has a
broader mating filter than *C. formosanus* and tries to pair with
non-female individuals, as shown in a cricket \[29\], a burying beetle
\[30\], and a water strider \[31\]. Furthermore, although all of the
previous studies have considered the SSB between individuals of
signal-receiving sex (typically males) \[4,7,28\], our results also
indicated that the evolution of sexual signals could also affect the
evolution of SSB between signal-sending sex (typically females), where
stronger signals might attract same-sex individuals and lead to
sender-sender SSB. This newly suggested relationship needs further
empirical tests in other animal lineages, possibly in the context of
variable densities of available partners.

In summary, our study highlights the diversity of SSB that can exist
even within a closely related species. By connecting mating behavior in
heterosexual contexts with the occurrence of SSB across species,
comparative behavioral analysis has the potential to answer the
questions relating to the evolution of SSB.

**Text S1. Comparison of heterosexual tandems across experimental
years.**

This study detected a clear difference in stability and time spent on
heterosexual tandem running behavior between *C. formosanus* and *C.
gestroi* (Figure 1, S1). However, this result contradicts the previous
study that found a similar level of tandem stability between these two
species (see Figure 1 of \[16\]). To investigate the source of this
inconsistency, we reanalyzed the data of previous studies using *C.
formosanus* and *C. gestroi* in this region \[16,18\] using the same
methodology as this study. We have three different datasets: one
obtained in 2019 only for *C. gestroi* to investigate their
density-dependent behavioral change, one obtained in 2020 for both
species to investigate the heterospecific tandem runs, and one obtained
in 2021 for both species in this study (Table S1).

In *C. formosanus*, there was no difference between this study and a
previous study in the duration of each tandem run (mixed-effects Cox
model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 0.132, *P* = 0.716; Figure S2A) and
total time spent in tandem runs (t-test, *t*<sub>15.7</sub> = 0.162, *P*
= 0.873, *d* = 0.052; Figure S2B). On the other hand, in *C. gestroi*,
we found different stabilities of tandem runs across studies, where
results obtained in 2020 showed marginally higher duration of tandem
runs compared to others (mixed-effects Cox model,
χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 6.36, *P* = 0.042; Tukey’s HSD, 2020-2019:
*z* = 1.90, *P* = 0.134, 2021-2019: *z* = 0.815, *P* = 0.688, 2021-2020:
*z* = 2.52, *P* = 0.031; Figure S2A). Note that the total time spent in
tandem runs was not different among studies (ANOVA, *F*<sub>2</sub> =
0.51, *P* = 0.603; 2020-2019: *d* = 0.316, 2021-2019: *d* = 0.013,
2021-2020: *d* = 0.417; Figure S2B). When we compared the tandem running
behavior between two *Coptotermes* termites by accounting for the
experimental years as a random effect, *C. formosanus* showed higher
stability (mixed-effects Cox model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 45.6,
*P* \< 0.001, Figure S2A) and a longer period of tandem runs than *C.
gestroi* (linear mixed-effects model, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 20.8,
*P* \< 0.001, Figure S2B). Thus, tandem running stability is actually
different between *C. gestroi* and *C. formosanus*, but Mizumoto et al.,
2021 \[16\] failed to detect the difference probability due to the
smaller sample size (Table S1).

In *C. gestroi*, why did the experiment in 2020 show higher stability of
tandem runs compared to 2019 and 2021, even if the difference is small?
This experiment focused on the interspecific tandem runs between *C.
gestroi* and *C. formosanus*; thus, they observed their tandem runs on
the date when both species swarmed together, which needs to be the very
end of the swarming season of *C. gestroi* and the beginning of that of
*C. formosanus* \[15\] (Table S1). As physiological conditions of
termite alates can change across the swarming seasons in both *C.
gestroi* and *C. formosanus* \[32\], this variability of the swarming
season might have changed their tandem running behavior, too. Further
studies need to clarify this hypothesis.
