**Abstract**

Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is an enigma in behavioral ecology as it
does not result in reproduction, contrasting with normal heterosexual
behavior. Proximately, the loss of sexual signals is thought to be
critical in the evolution of SSB as smaller sex differences may lead to
indiscriminate mating. However, if animals engage in SSB even after
recognizing the partner as the same-sex, sexual signal can enhance SSB
as in heterosexual pairing. Here we show that the strength of sex
pheromone is associated with the frequency of same-sex pairing in two
*Coptotermes* termites. In termites, mating pairs engage in tandem runs,
where a male follows a female that produces sex pheromones. We found
that the female-female tandem was more common in *C. formosanus* whose
females produce more pheromones. On the other hand, male-male tandem was
more common in *C. gestroi*, whose males usually follow females with
less pheromone. Furthermore, female-female tandem was more common than
male-male tandem in *C. formosanus*, while female-female and male-male
tandem were equally observed in *C. gestroi*. These results suggest that
the strength of sexual signals predicts the same-sex pairing in a
sex-specific manner. The proximate mechanism of SSB can be diverse,
reflecting their heterosexual context.

**Introduction**

Same-sex sexual behavior (SSB) is widespread among diverse animals with
considerable variations across taxa \[1–3\]. In most species, the SSB is
considered the result of mistaken identity \[3,4\], while in some cases,
SSB provides adaptive value by making the best of a bad job with the
shortage of heterosexual partner \[5,6\]. In either case, the occurrence
of SSB is dependent on the mode of mating strategy in regular
heterosexual contexts and is strongly affected by the accuracy and
carefulness of sex identification of the mating partner \[7\]. Sexual
communication, which is mediated via sex-specific attracting signals
(e.g., sex pheromones), underlies such sexual identification of the
other sex. Therefore, even if the SSB does not have adaptive value, the
evolutionary patterns of sexual signals could shape the diversity of SSB
across species, as a by-product. However, the role of sex-specific
signals in SSB has remained unexplored.

As signal senders and receivers play different roles in mate pairing
(refs), the effect of sexual signals on SSB should differ between
sender-sender pairs and receiver-receiver pairs. For example, strength
of sexual signals has the opposite effect on the sender-sender SSB and
receiver-receiver SSB. In the species with weak sex-specific signals,
more frequent SSB between receivers is expected, compared with the
species with strong signals \[8\]. With small sexual differences,
receivers can locate other receivers as well as senders, which may also
provoke mistaken identity of the sex of partner. On the other hand, more
SSB between signal senders could be possible in the species with strong
signals. It is rarer to observe SSB between senders as they are usually
passive sex during mating \[9\]. But with strong signals, it is easier
for even senders to find other senders than other receivers. Thus, the
strength of sexual signals is expected to modify the relative occurrence
of receiver-receiver and sender-sender SSB across species.

Mate pairing in neoisopetran termites (termites here after) provides an
ideal model system to study the evolution of SSB. Termites form
life-long monogamous pairs to establish colonies \[10\]. During a brief
period, alates (winged adults) disperse from their nests. Both females
and males land on the ground, shed their wings, and run to search for a
mating partner. Upon joining, a pair performs a tandem run. The male
follows the female, maintaining contact in a highly coordinated manner
while seeking a suitable site for colony foundation. Although tandem
running often involves communication via sex pheromones, same-sex tandem
run can be observed in either sex \[11,12\]. Sex pheromone should play
different roles between female-female pairs and male-male pairs. In
male-male pairs, same-sex tandem can happen once one male started to
follow another male. Thus, SSB can happen because of mistaken identity.
This implies that species with weak sex pheromones provoke male-male
tandem pairing. On the other hand, female-female tandem cannot happen
because of mistaken identity. As the sex role is fixed (females do not
follow males) \[12,13\], female-female tandem runs initiate after one
female changed sex role in advance. In this situation, sex pheromones of
females rather facilitate same-sex tandems because females can easily
follow another female.

In this study, we compared the same-sex tandem running behavior in two
*Coptotermes* termites: *Coptotermes formosanus* and *Coptotermes
gestroi*. These two species share the same chemical for sex pairing
pheromones \[14\] and can form heterosexual tandem runs \[15,16\].
However, the quantity of pheromones is different between these two
species, where *C. formosanus* has 10 times more pheromones than *C.
gestroi* \[14\]. Therefore, we predict that male-male tandem is more
frequent in *C. gestroi* than *C. formosanus*, while female-female
tandem is more frequent in *C. formosanus* than *C. gestroi*.

**Methods**

*Termites and experimental arena*

We collected alates using a light-trapping system at dusk between 27-29
March for *C. gestroi* and 21-22 April, 1-2 May for *C. formosanus* in
2021 in Broward County (Florida, USA) during synchronized dispersal
flights. All alates were collected at a single site. We brought the
alates to the laboratory and maintained them on wet cardboard at 28°C.
We used individuals who did not shed their wings by themselves to
prevent any prior experience of tandem runs. After inducing shedding
their wings, we observed their behaviors within 12 h. Each individual
was used only once.

We performed all observations in an experimental arena made by filling a
Petri dish (ø = 150 mm) with moistened plaster. The Petri dish had a
clear lid during observations. A video camera (XXX) above the arena was
adjusted so that the arena filled the camera frame. We introduced a pair
of the termite into the arena. Each pair was recorded for 30 minutes in
30 frames per second (FPS). In total, we obtained 49, 61, and 44 videos
for female-male, female-female, and male-male in *C. formosanus*; and
40, 40, and 45 videos for female-male, female-female, and male-male in
*C. gestroi*. We extracted the coordinates of the centroids of termite
movements from all obtained video, using the video-tracking system
UMATracker \[17\]. We down sampled all coordinates to a rate of five FPS
for subsequent analyses. We measured the diameter of dish and body
length of two termites in pixel for each video, using a python program
(link to github).

*Tandem analysis*

To compare the duration of tandem run between pair combinations and
species, we automatically determined that pairs were in tandem when the
distance between their centroids was within the sum of their body
length. This simplest threshold is used in a previous study \[18\], and
using other complex definitions (e.g., \[16,19\]) did not change the
conclusion. We did not count very short interactions (\< 5 seconds
within two body length) as tandem runs and small separation (\< 2
seconds) during tandem as interruptions.

To compare the duration of tandem runs between species and combinations,
we used mixed-effects Cox models \[coxme() function in the coxme package
in R \[20\]\], with pair combination (or species) treated as a fixed
effect and the ID of each video as a random effect. We compared the
durations between species for each combination (heterosexual,
female–female, or male–male) and among combinations for each species,
separately. We also compared the proportion of the total time spent
performing tandem runs across different pair combinations (or species),
after transforming proportional data using logit-transformation after
adding 0.01 to the observed proportions to avoid infinite values \[21\].
We used Welch t-test to compare them between species for each pair
combination, while one-way anova with Tukey’s HSD to compare among
combinations for each species.

Finally, we compared movement speed using t-test and anova during tandem
runs after obtaining mean traveled distances between two successive
frames for each individual.

All data analyses were performed using R v4.3.0 \[22\], and source codes
are available at github().

**Results**

**Discussion**

All of the previous studies on same-sex tandem runs in termites have
focused on *Reticulitermes* termites \[11,12,23\]. In *Reticulitermes*
termites, same-sex pairing functions by providing survival benefits
\[5,11,24\] and is not result of mistaken identity \[12\]. However, our
study illustrates the distinct pattern in *Coptotermes* termites, where
same-sex tandem in *Coptotermes* termites is rather accidental. First,
in *Reticulitermes* termites, same-sex tandem pairs were as stable as
heterosexual tandem pairs and formed a long-term relationship \[12\]. In
*Coptotermes* termites, on the other hand, even once they form a
same-sex tandem pair, either female-female and male-male tandems were
far less stable than heterosexual tandems. This suggests that
*Coptotermes* termites do not adjust their movement patterns to maintain
same-sex tandems. Such lower motivation can be seen in their movement
patterns upon accidental separation. Therefore, we conclude that
same-sex tandem in *Coptotermes* termites is less functional than
*Reticulitermes* termites.

Even though the same-sex pairing of Coptotermes termites is not
adaptive, our study on their interspecific variations shows the
proximate explanation of the diversity in SSB.
